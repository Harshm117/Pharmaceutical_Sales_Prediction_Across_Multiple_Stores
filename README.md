Pharmaceutical Sales prediction across multiple stores

## Overview
## Business Need
You work at Nexthikes as a Machine Learning Engineer and a company called Rossmann Pharmaceuticals has given you a project on sales forecasting. The finance team wants to forecast sales in all their stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time. Managers in individual stores rely on their years of experience as well as their personal judgement to forecast sales. 

The data team identified factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality as necessary for predicting sales across the various stores.

Your job is to build and serve an end-to-end product that delivers this prediction to analysts in the finance team.
